# Automatic extraction of handwritten text from an image

Converting handwritten text into machine-readable text presents a significant challenge due to the considerable variation in handwriting styles among individuals and the relatively lower quality of handwritten text when compared to printed text.A Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model is designed and implemented which is capable of recognizing distinct handwritten characters, each with its unique style. This model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 95%, signifying its capability to accurately identify individual characters within handwritten text.
